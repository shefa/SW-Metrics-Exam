# SW-Metrics-Exam
## Task
* Create a program with TDD and measure the coverage for the math-function factorial.
* Create a Jenkins job for the math-function.
* Send the Jenkins log file and link to the repository.

Source files
------
* test_all.py - Contains the unit tests for the factorial function, that needs to be implemented.
* factorial.py - The implementation of the actual factorial function

Versions (for TDD)
------
The unit test source initially had no docstrings, so they were added.
The factorial source was written without exception handling in ver1 and was added later in ver2, upon testing with the unit test.
